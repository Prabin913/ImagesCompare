	 * @li Customize the object by calling @ref vz::ImgCmp::set_flag() or manually settings values such as @ref vz::ImgCmp::min_contour_area.
	 * @li Set the master image with @ref vz::ImgCmp::set_master_image().
	 * @li Compare the master image against a new image with @ref vz::ImgCmp::compare().
	 * @li Copy the structures that are needed, such as @ref differences_contours or @ref differences_threshold.
	 * @li Optionally ask the library to annotate the image with a call to @ref vz::ImgCmp::annotate().
	 * @li Then the cycle repeats with a new call to @ref vz::ImgCmp::compare().
